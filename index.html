            <h5>I'm <b>Lerrica Jeremy S. Torreno</b> enrolled under the program Bachelor 
            of Science in Computer Science with Specialization in Data Science for the 
            Academic year 2023-2024.</h5> <br> <p>Being a Computer Science student gives me the 
            adrenaline rush to know something that most people don’t. 
            It never fails to pique my interest in how technology evolves faster than anything. 
            I am beyond thankful to be in a healthy and open-learning environment, where 
            I can freely approach my peers and professors for consultation or criticism. </p>

            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <h5>Academic background and extracurricular activities</h5><br>
            <h6><b>Junior High School</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>I started my Junior High School at St. Joseph’s Academy in Las Pinas City.</li>
                <li>It was quite the experience since it was my first time being one and I enjoyed the 
                    responsibility that came with it. I spent the remaining years of my Junior High School 
                    as a normal student without any responsibilities, but studying.</li>
                <li>I was involved in various clubs such as, arts club, badminton club, and dance club. 
                    I also joined some sports, specifically, badminton where I won <b>2nd place.</b> After 4 years 
                    of hardwork and perseverance, <b>I graduated junior high school with high honors.</b> </li>
            </ul>

            <h6><i>Science Investigatory Project</i></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Our Science Investigatory Project during my 2nd year was almost qualified to be a part of 
                    the Science expo and we were supposed to represent our school. It was about a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/apple-cider-vinegar-hair">hair conditioner
                    that can make your hair grow even longer</a> and it can also
                    give you a shiny hair. However, <b>we only reached 2nd place over-all</b>, but still it was a great experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6><b>Senior High School</b></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>I was anxious to leave my previous school, however, I enjoyed and grew a lot from my experiences
                    in senior high school.</li>
                <li>I was involved in organizations in the University of Prpetual Help System DALTA such as, <i>MahuSci (Math and Science) organization and was part 
                    of the survey and research team</i>. I was also a candidate for recognition and thankfully, 
                    <b>I finished my grade 11 with high honors.</b></li>
                <li>In my last year of senior high school I was quite an active student, I was involved in various organizations, 
                    <i>AAPS (AngatAgham Perpetualite Science) and FLAMED (an organization for class officers)</i>.</li>
                <li>I was involved in many activities as well, especially during our Sports fest. Without even realizing, my 
                    last year as a high school was about to end and <b>I graduated with honors.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h6><i>Research</i></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Qualitative research deals with non-numerical data such as, opinions, understanding, and such. It was a huge 
                    achievement considering that I was grouped with my uncooperative group mates and our research adviser that rarely 
                    guides us. Thankfully, <b>I finished our research with minor revisions.</b></li>
                <li>Quantitative research is the opposite of qualitative, it deals with numerical values and mathematical computations. 
                    It was another accomplishment by me and my group mates who were all willing to try out new things. Despite not having 
                    any review of related literature about <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/jute-leaves">Jute leaves</a> <b>we were still able to defend it thoroughly and finished our research 
                    with minimal revisions.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Skills and Competencies</h5><br>
            <ul>
                <li>I developed my <b>communication skills</b> in my senior high school, due to the various presentations and defenses that we 
                    had to go through, along with being <b>well-verse in time and project management.</b></li>
                <li>I genuinely enjoyed research in my 12th grade, so I believe that I have the <b>research skills</b> when it comes 
                    to handling problems.</li>
                <li>In my 11th grade, I was the leader for various subjects and I can say that I even grew in my 12th grade through 
                    giving them motivational words, open communication, and most of all <b>teamwork which is very essential in groups.</b></li>
                <li><i>These skills and competencies would help me to have an advantage when it comes to working in teams, being a competent 
                    and consistent professional, and to be a great presenter.</i></li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Career Goals</h5><br>
            <ul>
                <li>One of my long-term career goals is to <b>gain more knowledge by developing my skills</b> further, since I am interested in 
                    <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> and <i>data science</i> which are both part of the industry trends and part of my curriculum. </li>
                <li>Another long-term goal of mine is to <b>have my own startup</b>, because I want to develop a product that has been on my mind 
                    for quite some time, it mainly deals with integrating AI on NFC tags, it would be a long journey for me for sure. </li>
                <li>Lastly, <b>to become an expert in my field</b> to the point that I would play a vital role in a company, in simple words, <i>irreplaceable</i>. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <h4>Major Overview</h4><br>
            <h5>I chose my major out of desire to take on something <b>very challenging</b> that will surely pay off once I graduate.</h5> 
            <p> I consider myself as a very curious person, especially when it comes to <b>technology and science</b>, because of it I 
                have these constant ambitions to be a person that would create a technology that would benefit everyone. Personally, I 
                think my major’s unique aspect is it <i>deals with math, science, and technology itself all at the same time</i> which is quite 
                complicated. However, I think that it fits my academic goal which is to <b>develop my skills further</b>, because I am well-versed with 
                literature, english, and creative writing, so if I would develop my other side which is being knowledgeable in technology I would 
                achieve my <b>professional goal which is to have a profession that would develop my sides that are lacking.</b></p><br>
            
            <h4>Research or Internship Experience</h4><br>
            <h5>I had both <b>qualitative and quantitative research</b> during my senior high school days.</h5>
            <p>Those 2 research shaped me to <b>become flexible to adapt in any situation</b> that I may be in and as well as to be a 
            <b>critical thinker</b> by providing solutions that would be sufficient to the problem the group is facing.
